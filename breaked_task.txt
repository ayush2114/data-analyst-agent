Okay, here's a breakdown of the tasks into smaller, programmable steps to answer your questions:

**1. Source Data & Initial Setup**

*   **1.1. Data Source:** The primary data source is the Wikipedia page:  `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films`.

*   **1.2. Data Extraction:**  Use a web scraping library (e.g., `BeautifulSoup`, `Scrapy`, `requests`) to extract the table containing the film data from the HTML of the Wikipedia page.  Identify the correct table on the page (likely by inspecting the HTML source).
*   **1.3. Data Transformation:**  Clean the extracted data. This includes:
    *   Converting gross revenue (e.g., "$2.8 billion") into numerical values (e.g., 2800000000).
    *   Converting release year to numeric format
    *   Handling missing or erroneous values.

**2. Get Metadata About That Data**

*   **2.1. Column Identification:** Identify the relevant columns in the scraped table.  These will likely include:
    *   Rank
    *   Title
    *   Worldwide Gross
    *   Year
    *   Peak (This needs to be clarified: Is this related to the highest grossing *at a certain point in time*? Need to know the source data column name to be sure.)
*   **2.2. Data Type Identification:** Determine the data type of each column (e.g., integer for Rank and Year, float for Worldwide Gross, string for Title).

**3. Send Metadata to LLM and Ask LLM to Generate Code**

*   **3.1. Construct Prompts:** Create prompts for an LLM (like Gemini) that detail the following:
    *   The task: "You are a data analyst.  You will be given data extracted from a Wikipedia table of highest-grossing films. You will then answer questions about that data."
    *   The data source, including the URL.
    *   The columns identified and the corresponding data types.
    *   **Question 1 Prompt:** "Write Python code to calculate the number of films released before 2000 that grossed $2 billion or more (Worldwide Gross). The output should be a JSON array of strings containing the answer."
    *   **Question 2 Prompt:** "Write Python code to determine the earliest film that grossed over $1.5 billion (Worldwide Gross). The output should be a JSON array of strings containing the answer.  The answer should include the film title."
    *   **Question 3 Prompt:** "Write Python code to calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the 'Rank' and 'Peak' columns of the data. The output should be a JSON array of strings containing the answer."
    *   **Question 4 Prompt:** "Write Python code to create a scatter plot of 'Rank' (x-axis) and 'Peak' (y-axis) with a dotted red regression line. Save the plot as a PNG image, encode it in base64, and return a data URI of the form  `data:image/png;base64,...` under 100,000 bytes."
*   **3.2. LLM Interaction:** Send each prompt to the LLM (e.g., using the `gemini-2.0-flash-lite` model and the provided `client.models.generate_content` call.)
*   **3.3. Code Extraction:** Extract the generated Python code from the LLM's responses.

**4. Execute Code & Handle Errors**

*   **4.1. Code Execution:** Use the `subprocess` module in Python to run the generated code.
    *   Ensure that the Python environment has the necessary libraries installed (e.g., `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `requests`, `beautifulsoup4` or `scrapy`).
    *   **Important:** The generated code will need to:
        *   Scrape the Wikipedia page (you may need to provide the URL or embed it in the code).
        *   Parse the HTML and extract the table.
        *   Clean the data.
        *   Perform the calculations as requested.
        *   Format the output as a JSON array of strings (for questions 1, 2, and 3) or a data URI (for question 4).
*   **4.2. Error Handling:**  Catch any errors that occur during code execution (e.g., `subprocess.CalledProcessError`).
*   **4.3. Code Correction Loop:** If the code fails or produces incorrect output:
    *   **4.3.1. Error Analysis:** Examine the error messages or the incorrect output to understand the problem.
    *   **4.3.2. LLM Feedback:** Send the error messages and the original code back to the LLM in a new prompt. Ask the LLM to correct the code, explaining the issues and the desired behavior.
    *   **4.3.3. Iterate:** Repeat steps 4.1 and 4.2 until the code runs successfully and produces the correct results.  You may need multiple rounds of correction.

**Example Code Structure (Illustrative - the LLM will generate the actual code):**

```python
import subprocess
import json
import base64  # for data URI

# ---  (1. Source Data & Initial Setup) ---

# Define your scraping code (e.g., using requests and BeautifulSoup)
def scrape_wikipedia_data(url):
    # ... (scrape the data and return as a list of lists or pandas DataFrame)
    pass

# --- (2. Get Metadata) --

# Example: Assuming data is a pandas DataFrame named 'df'
# df.columns  # shows column names
# df.dtypes # shows datatypes

# --- (4. Execute Code & Handle Errors) ---
def run_code(code_snippet):
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(["python", "-c", code_snippet], capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)
        return result.stdout.strip()  # Remove any leading/trailing whitespace
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        return f"Error: {e}\n{e.stderr}"

# --- (Main Execution Loop, after getting code from the LLM) ---
# Example (for Question 1):
# question_1_code = """
# import pandas as pd
# import json
# import requests
# from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
#
# url = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films"
# response = requests.get(url)
# soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
# table = soup.find('table', {'class': 'wikitable sortable'})
#
# # Assuming the table is structured as described in earlier steps
# rows = table.find_all('tr')[1:]  # Skip the header row
#
# data = []
# for row in rows:
#     cols = row.find_all('td')
#     if len(cols) >= 4:
#         try:
#             rank = int(cols[0].text.strip())
#             title = cols[1].text.strip()
#             gross_str = cols[4].text.strip()
#             year = int(cols[6].text.strip())
#
#             # Clean gross revenue (converting 'Billion', etc.)
#             gross_str = gross_str.replace(",", "")  # Remove commas
#             if "billion" in gross_str.lower():
#                 gross = float(gross_str.lower().replace(" billion", "")) * 1000000000
#             elif "million" in gross_str.lower():
#                 gross = float(gross_str.lower().replace(" million", "")) * 1000000
#             else:
#                 gross = float(gross_str)
#
#             data.append([rank, title, gross, year])
#         except ValueError:
#             continue
#
# df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['Rank', 'Title', 'Worldwide Gross', 'Year'])
#
# filtered_df = df[(df['Year'] < 2000) & (df['Worldwide Gross'] >= 2000000000)]
# count = len(filtered_df)
#
# print(json.dumps([str(count)]))
# """
#
# output = run_code(question_1_code)
# print(output) # Output should be a JSON array of string.
#
# # Error handling and correction loop would go here,
# #  if the initial `run_code` call fails.
```

This detailed breakdown, combined with the iterative error-handling loop, should enable you to successfully answer all your questions by leveraging the LLM's code-generation capabilities.  Remember to replace the placeholder scraping and data-cleaning logic with actual, working code.
